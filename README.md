The Centauri Carbon "Stock-to-Super" Mod complete overhaul.

The Centauri Carbon "Stock-to-Super" Mod is COMPLETE!
I’ve officially finished the ground-up rebuild of this Centauri Carbon. What started as a broken unit is now a high-performance machine with Full Klipper firmware and a documented build guide.
I’ve maintained the stock form factor while completely overhauling the internals for maximum speed and multi-material capability.
The "Super" Build Specs:
• Control System: Upgraded to a BTT Octopus Pro (STM32H723) paired with a Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB) and a 7" touchscreen.
• 48V High-Speed Motion: X/Y axes upgraded to 48V using LDO NEMA17 Super Power motors and BTT TMC5160T Pro drivers, powered by a dedicated 48V 600W PSU.
• Factory 24V Integration: The Octopus Pro, EBB36, Z-axis, and AMS steppers all run off the original factory 24V PSU using TMC2209 drivers.
• Thermal Performance: Pushed the stock hotend to 350°C (via BTT EBB36 CAN Bus) and the bed to 120°C.
• Precision Leveling: Integrated an ADS1220 to boost the stock strain gauge system for significantly better precision and increased probing speed.
• 5-Color "Active-Active" AMS: Custom push-pull multi-material system featuring a modded turtle-neck buffer.
Firmware & Guides:
The full Firmware files and the comprehensive "How-To" Guide for the 48V setup are now available in the Files section of this group.
Thanks for following the build. If you're looking to push your Centauri to these specs, everything you need is now uploaded!
